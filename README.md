    - [app](https://github.com/detiuaveiro/project-1---vulnerabilities-equipa_4/tree/master/app): contains the vulnerable application, all vulnerabilities will be inside that folder. To run this app we can execute the next command:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

    - [app_sec](https://github.com/detiuaveiro/project-1---vulnerabilities-equipa_4/tree/master/app_sec): contains the safe app, protected from all implemented vulnerabilities in the vulnerable app. To run it we can execute the same command:
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```
